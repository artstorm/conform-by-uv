Conform By UV v1.0
==================
LightWave Modeler LScript.

Programmed by Johan Steen.
Ideas, Logo and Testing by Lee Perry-Smith. http://www.ir-ltd.net/


Description
===========
Conforms the foreground mesh to the background by using the UV coordinates
as reference, which makes point order irrelevant as long as the UV map's 
layout matches.
Can also be used to batch conform morph vertex maps and to cleanup UV
data.


Usage
=====
See http://www.artstorm.net/plugins/conform-by-uv/ for usage instructions.


Installation
============
* Copy JS_ConformByUV.lsc to LightWave’s plug-in folder.
* If "Autoscan Plugins" is enabled, just restart LightWave and it's installed.

* Else, locate the “Add Plugins” button in LightWave and add them manually.

I’d recommend to add the plugin to a convenient spot in LightWave’s menu,
so all you have to do is press the Conform by UV button when you need to
use it.


Compability
===========
Conform by UV has been tested with LightWave 3D 9.6, Win32, Win64.
